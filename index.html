    <h1>Hi there,</h1>
    <p> My name is Niels and welcome to my little blog. Just a warning at the beginning, you will find many typo's and a few wrong written sentences.</p>
    <p> Why a blog? Well I have often difficulties to understand something, I often need explanation for myself with my own words. Another point is
    I often have to research soemthing, in this time I feel unprodictive because I don't produce code. I just write it down so I feel a little more productive .-)</p>
    
    <p> Recent blog posts:</p>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
